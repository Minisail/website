This file makes the assumption that you need to rescue lost web content from the 
Internet Archive, or the "Wayback Machine".  It depends on the archive having 
taken a copy of your web pages in the first place; if it hasn't, you're in 
trouble!

In the following notes, I'm going to rescue the "History of the Minisail" page 
from/to minisail.org.uk.

 1) Find your site backup:
    ----------------------
    In your web browser, navigate to the Wayback Machine:
      https://archive.org/web/
    Then search for your site.  In this case, I'm searching for 
      "minisail.org.uk"
    As of April 8th 2017, the site has been backed up 45 times between 2001 and 
    2016.  I'm going to choose the latest backup made on 2nd October 2016.
    
 2) Navigate to the page you want:
    ------------------------------
    The Wayback Machine displays a copy of the website as it was, complete with 
    menu.  So use the menu to navigate to the page you actually want.  In this 
    case, I want the main "History" page.  Don't worry about the URL - as the 
    original was WordPress, it carries a "?page_id=11" tag at the end...

 3) Get the source code:
    --------------------
    Now right-click the displayed web page and select "view source".  There's 
    loads of code for the Wayback Machine, then a whole load more for WordPress.  
    But if you're careful, you should be able to scroll down and see a section 
    that makes sense, headed by a line that says:
      <div class="entry-content">
    Copy everything following this line as far as the line that says:
      </div><!-- .entry-content -->
    You'll need to put it somewhere - I've put it into a temporary text file 
    called "untitled.txt".  Hmm, that was imaginative...
 
 4) Create a new webpage:
    ---------------------
    If you're reading this, you're presumably already logged in to the website 
    and able to create and edit pages.  So make a copy of an existing page (a 
    simple one like contact.php would be good), and give it a suitable new name.  
    In this case, I'll name it history.php
     
 5) Edit the page content:
    ----------------------
    Now put all the content you've just rescued into your new "history.php".  
    It needs to go in between the line that says:
      <!-- The main page content follows.  You can change this as you wish -->
    and the line that says:
      <!-- End of main page content -->

 6) View the page and tidy it up:
    -----------------------------
    Now navigate in your browser to your website (in this case, 
    minisail.org.uk).  See what the page looks like.  You won't have a menu 
    entry yet, so you'll have to type in the page name manually, i.e.:
      http://minisail.org.uk/history.php
    In this particular example, the only real problem is that the page heading 
    is in <h1>, and page template is designed to look better with titles in 
    <h3>.  So in this step, I've changed the <h1></h1> tags to <h3></h3>. 
    
 7) Add the new page to the menu:
    -----------------------------
    It's not much use having a page rescued if no one knows it's there!  So 
    let's add it to the menu.  To do this:
    - navigate into the [trimsite] directory
    - edit webpage.ini
    - at the end of the file, you'll find a section that is headed:
      [menu]
    - add a line that says something like:
      History = history.php
      (History is the label that will come up in the menu, and history.php is 
      the page that it will go to).
    - Save the modified webpage.ini
    
And that's it!  Maybe it would be good to have a final check in the browser to 
make sure everything is as intended.

If you have a go at this and it all gets messed up, don't worry.  We can fix 
it!  Just let me know.  I'll make sure I'm keeping regular back-ups.
